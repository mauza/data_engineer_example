# Data Engineering Example ETL Pipeline

The goal of this repo is to show a somewhat contrived example of a data engineering ETL pipeline.
Although it is contrived it will also exaggerate in places maybe taking unnecessary steps for the sake
of demonstrating some import aspect of data engineering or technology that wouldn't be covered otherwise.

### The Goal:

We will be scraping and streaming data engineer job postings so we can perform analysis on what companies
look for when hiring data engineers.

## The Steps
 
[put pretty diagram here]

### Step 1: Data at the source

### Step 2: Kafka the immutable queue

### Step 3: Using flat files

### Step 4: You can't run from sql

### Step 5: Where most data ends up eventually (in a visualization)
